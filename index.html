                    <p>runfast is a tool for quickly running a project, or
                    script, or whatever you're working on! its highly
                    configurable through a concise toml config file. i use this
                    program through tmux, to have a project im working on in
                    the terminal available for easy access. it features the
                    ability to select from a set of default and user defined
                    'runners' such as 'cargo run', and lots of them have
                    variables, for instance a 'cargo run --bin {}' which allows
                    you to quickly create a runner that is useful for your
                    project. there are of course pre-defined runners, but
                    creating your own is simple enough.<br></br>

                    <p>tps is a tool for managing working with projects in
                    tmux, the idea is to create a tmux session for each project
                    directory, that can then be switched between or created
                    with the fuzzy find interface the software supplies. It
                    searches projects on open, from 'project home' directories,
                    and has out of the box support for opening different
                    branches in git worktrees.
